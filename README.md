# Promises, Promises

These are just some implementations of javascript promises and a few examples of their usage.

Note: these promises are not compliant with CommonJS Promises/A, yet.  (But neither is 
jQuery's Deferred. :) )

Also: check out @briancavalier's [when.js](https://github.com/briancavalier/when.js)!
This is where we'll likely do most of the future development.
